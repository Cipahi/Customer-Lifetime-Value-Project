## Customer Lifetime Value = Customer Future Value + Customer Historic Value

Under this project -
* Built customer churn and margin models using OLS Regression, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting (GB) algorithms with about 85-90% accuracy to predict churn and margin rates and understand important factors responsible for churn
* Calculated CFV for all customers; Segmented and profiled customers using demographics to understand customersâ€™ behavior (used Tableau for profiling customers)

1. Data --> churn and margin data used
2. CLV_Data_Prep.ipynb --> data preparation notebook
3. CLV_Churn_Modeling.ipynb --> churn modeling notebook
4. CLV_Margin_Modeling.ipynb --> margin modeling notebook
5. CLV_Calculations.ipynb --> used results from both churn and margin models to calculate customer future value
